Purpose of the project:
	The concept behind this project was to create a multi faceted tool for musicians with a heavy focus on rock. From ai generated tunes to finding potential band members, we attempted to create a comprehensive tool for all musicians
	1. One of our main and most compelling features is a collaboration with AI models to either generate music or enhance the user's music. This feature is meant to inspire up and coming musicians, and let them explore tracks while being able to see their own work grow with it. 
 	2. This site offers users the opportunity to 'collab' with songs by established artists through the use of the Spotify database and an AI Model.
