Purpose of the project:
	The concept behind this project was to create a multi faceted tool for musicians with a heavy focus on rock. From ai generated tunes to finding potential band members, we attempted to create a comprehensive tool for all musicians
	1. One of our main and most compelling features is a collaboration with AI models to either generate music or enhance the user's music. This feature is meant to inspire up and coming musicians, and let them explore tracks while being able to see their own work grow with it. 
 	2. This site offers users the opportunity to 'collab' with songs by established artists through the use of the Spotify database and an AI Model. To start, the user can either choose to browse through the available artists or search the name of their preferred artist. Then, they can collaborate with that track created by the artist. 
  		- Future implications of this might include letting users upload their own tracks and interact with each other to let them find potential band members. 
	3. Our most creative feature is the implementation of a 3D model that allows the user to choose thier concert experience based on their genre of rock. For example, Rock blues would have a more subdued theme with moodier lighting and auditorium seating. Hard rock, on the other hand, could have an open arena for the audience to stand, bright lighting, and much more energetic mood.

Problems we ran into and potential solutions:
	One of our biggest learning curves was trying to integrate multiple structures of heirarchy into the same model. For example, the organization of the overall website differs entirely from the collaborate page, and this differs entirely from the visualize page. This taught us to map out our website in a heirarchial format to ensure the creation of a user-friendly interface. 
 	This project also challenged us to leave our comfort zone by using programs like Blender which we hadn't used before. Learning the implementation of these programs in a time crunch proved to be a challenge, however, gave us valuable experience and a framework for a better understanding of the software. 
  	Another problem we faced was embedding the AI generated model into a web-page as we weren't able to convert it into a typical website format. However, we were able to create the AI model itself and use it to generate music, which gave us a substantial amount of headway. 


Public Frameworks Utilized: AWS EC2 instance, S3 bucket, and sageMaker.
API's utilized: 
       The following API's were generated and used for our website to access content in other resources
               1. musify.lol API token - This API token was used to 
	       2. Spotify API- We used the spotify API to generate the carasole. 
	       3. Flock API
